Interpreting column names as follows:
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
N_CAS:	Number of cases
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
PVAL:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
N_CON:	Number of controls
